Assignment 4
Description

In this assignment you must read in a file of metropolitan regions and associated sports teams from assets/wikipedia_data.html and answer some questions about each metropolitan region. Each of these regions may have one or more teams from the "Big 4": NFL (football, in assets/nfl.csv), MLB (baseball, in assets/mlb.csv), NBA (basketball, in assets/nba.csv or NHL (hockey, in assets/nhl.csv). Please keep in mind that all questions are from the perspective of the metropolitan region, and that this file is the "source of authority" for the location of a given sports team. Thus teams which are commonly known by a different area (e.g. "Oakland Raiders") need to be mapped into the metropolitan region given (e.g. San Francisco Bay Area). This will require some human data understanding outside of the data you've been given (e.g. you will have to hand-code some names, and might need to google to find out where teams are)!

For each sport I would like you to answer the question: what is the win/loss ratio's correlation with the population of the city it is in? Win/Loss ratio refers to the number of wins over the number of wins plus the number of losses. Remember that to calculate the correlation with pearsonr, so you are going to send in two ordered lists of values, the populations from the wikipedia_data.html file and the win/loss ratio for a given sport in the same order. Average the win/loss ratios for those cities which have multiple teams of a single sport. Each sport is worth an equal amount in this assignment (20%*4=80%) of the grade for this assignment. You should only use data from year 2018 for your analysis -- this is important!
